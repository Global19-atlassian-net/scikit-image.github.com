scikits.image: An image processing toolbox for SciPy
====================================================

``scikits.image`` aims to provide algorithmic building blocks for
research in image processing and computer vision.  The package
contains code that is **well tested**, **documented** and **easily
maintainable**.  We support various computing backends, such as `NumPy
<http://numpy.scipy.org>`__ and `PyOpenCl
<http://mathema.tician.de/software/pyopencl>`__.
